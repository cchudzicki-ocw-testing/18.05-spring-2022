## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 80 minutes / session

Studios: 1 session / week, 50 minutes / session

## Prerequisites

[*18.02 Multivariable Calculus*](/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010)

## Course Description

This course provides an elementary introduction to probability and statistics with applications. Topics include: basic combinatorics, random variables, probability distributions, Bayesian inference, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and linear regression.

## Basic Structure of the Course

- We will take an active learning approach similar in some respects to TEAL.
- You must do the reading and answer reading questions before each class.
    - In class we will assume you have done the reading. We will lecture and work problems assuming this.
    - **We** ***do not*** **expect** that you will have mastered the material on first reading. The goal is to start the process, so class will be more productive.
    - The reading questions will prepare you for the harder questions we will work during class and on the problem sets.
    - The reading questions will count toward your grade.
- We meet three times a week.
    - Tuesday/Thursday (80 minutes each) will be a blend of lecture, concept questions and group problem solving.
    - Friday (50 minutes) will be a *"studio"* day. It will involve longer problems and the use of R. You will need to have your computer available on Fridays.
- We will use 'clicker questions' in class.
    - Participation on these questions will also count toward your grade.
    - In order to respond to these questions, you will need your phone or a laptop which can connect to our MITx site.
- R
    - We will make frequent use of R for computation, simulation and visualization.
    - We will teach you everything you need to know to use R as a tool in this class.
    - You will not be expected to do any hardcore computer programming.

## Groups

For in-class problem solving you will work in groups of 3.

- You will be able to choose your own group.
- After a week or so groups will be more or less permanent.
- Groups should sit together at tables.
- If you need to find a group or your group needs a third person let us know and we will help.

## Text

There will be no assigned text for the class. We will post the reading to this website.

## Problem Sets and Exams

- **Problem sets**
    - Problem sets will be due most weeks, usually on Monday, usually by 10 pm ET.
    - You will turn psets into Gradescope. We will provide a link on our class Canvas site.
    - Psets will have a *problem set checker* on MITx. This will allow you to check many of your answers before turning in the pset. This means you will be graded on how you arrive at and present your answer.
    - The graders have strict instructions not to accept work that is excessively sloppy or difficult to read.
        - Your work should be formatted like any paper or book. That is, it should be presented in lines that are written left to right and go down the page.
        - You should work the problem out on scratch paper first and then put the final version in your homework.
- **Exams**
    - There will be two in-class midterm exams and a comprehensive final exam.
    - The midterms will be designed to take 1 hour, but you will have the entire 80 minutes of class to finish.
    - We will have one R based quiz. For this quiz, you will be allowed to use the internet in any way except to communicate with other people.

## Grading

- Reading questions and in-class clicker questions will each count for 5% of your grade.
- Problem sets will count for 25% of your grade. In computing your pset average we will drop your lowest score.
- The R studios will count 5% of your grade.
- The midterm exams and R quiz combined will count for 30% of your grade (12.5%, 12.5%, 5%).
- The final exam will count for 30% of your grade.
